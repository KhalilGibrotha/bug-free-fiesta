## 1. Strategic Fit & Problem Alignment

**Objective:** Ensure ProGet provides measurable value and aligns with the automation, governance, and compliance framework established under the AAP Policy & Governance model.

| Evaluation Area | Key Questions | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Problem Definition** | What pain points is this solving (e.g., dependency sprawl, air-gapped EE builds, Windows packaging)? |  |
| **Existing Tools Overlap** | How does this complement or replace Quay, Satellite, or Private Automation Hub? |  |
| **Governance Alignment** | Does the proposal align with our AAP governance model (Develop → Main promotion, review gate)? |  |
| **Security & Auditability** | Can logs, approvals, and access be integrated with Splunk, Helix, and Okta/SailPoint? |  |
| **Toil Reduction & ROI** | How does it reduce manual processes or errors in our automation lifecycle? |  |

---

## 2. Integration & Workflow Fit

Aligns with the AAP Architecture & Execution Model, ensuring compatibility with existing identity, network, and change control processes.

| Area | Evaluation Criteria | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| **AAP Integration** | Can ProGet serve as a source for Python wheels, Chocolatey, or custom utilities in EE builds? |  |
| **Authentication** | Supports Okta / AD / SailPoint authentication consistent with AAP and enterprise identity governance? |  |
| **RBAC Alignment** | Role-based access mirrors AAP structure (Admin, Engineer, Operator, Auditor)? |  |
| **Network Reachability** | Supports multi-datacenter replication (KM & RTP)? Respects control plane segmentation? |  |
| **Change Control** | Integrates with BMC Helix for package approval and promotion to main? |  |
| **Audit Logging** | Can forward logs to Splunk or Helix for traceability and compliance review? |  |
| **DR & Backup** | Provides export/replication for DR (aligned with Zerto/Commvault RTO ≤ 24h)? |  |

## 3. Package Management Scope

### Windows Package Distribution

| Consideration | Expected Practice | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| **Distribution Mechanism** | Use Chocolatey only for *server builds and automation packaging*. |  |
| **Enterprise Standards** | MECM remains authoritative for workstation and production app deployment. |  |
| **Scope Definition** | Document approved use cases for Chocolatey within server automation or provisioning workflows. |  |

### Linux Package Handling

| Consideration | Expected Practice | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| **RHEL/Satellite Alignment** | Satellite remains authoritative for RPMs and OS patching. |  |
| **ProGet Role** | Used only for non-vendor dependencies (Python wheels, utilities). |  |
| **Air-Gapped Sync** | Supports offline export/import for EE build environments. |  |

---

## 4. SBOM & Provenance Support

| Evaluation Area | Key Questions | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **SBOM Formats** | Supports SPDX or CycloneDX for compliance reporting? |  |
| **Provenance Tracking** | Can associate packages with build metadata (who published, where used)? |  |
| **Integration with Compliance Tools** | Can export SBOM data to Splunk, Helix, or Archer for audit purposes? |  |
| **Dependency Tree View** | Provides full visibility into package chains used in EEs? |  |

---

## 5. Security & Compliance

| Control Area | Requirement | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Transport Security** | HTTPS/TLS via Venafi-issued certificate, HTTP → HTTPS redirect. |  |
| **Identity Governance** | Okta/SailPoint-managed RBAC for all users; no local accounts. |  |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Integration with Tenable or equivalent scanning mechanism. |  |
| **Change Management** | Formal promotion/approval through BMC Helix CAB workflows. |  |
| **Artifact Immutability** | Support for immutable package versions post-approval. |  |
| **Retention & Lifecycle** | Automated retention policy for stale/unapproved artifacts. |  |

---

## 6. Technical Validation Scenarios

| Test ID | Scenario | Expected Outcome | Status |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **T1** | Build EE from `ansible-builder` using Python wheels from ProGet → Quay → EE node. | Successful build & reproducibility validated. |  |
| **T2** | Deploy Windows bootstrap via Chocolatey sourced from ProGet. | Confirm package install reliability. |  |
| **T3** | Generate SBOM for EE and export to Helix/Splunk. | SBOM data accessible for audit. |  |
| **T4** | Validate access control via SailPoint AD groups. | Enforced & logged access confirmed. |  |
| **T5** | Simulate offline sync/export between KM ↔ RTP datacenters. | Packages replicated successfully. |  |

---

## 7. Value & Success Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Goal | Target / Baseline |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Dependency Resolution Time** | Time saved vs. manual EE dependency upload. |  |
| **EE Build Success Rate** | Reduction in failed builds due to missing packages. |  |
| **Compliance Coverage** | % of EEs with valid SBOM & provenance data. |  |
| **Security Findings** | Reduction in unverified or unsigned packages. |  |
| **Audit Readiness** | Time to produce audit trail (Splunk/Helix). |  |
